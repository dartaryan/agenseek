-- Story 4.6: Ensure time_spent_seconds column exists in user_progress table
-- Note: This column should already exist from the initial migration, but this ensures it
-- This column tracks the total time a user has spent reading a guide in seconds

-- The column already exists from migration 0003, so this is a no-op safety check
-- We keep this migration file for documentation purposes
