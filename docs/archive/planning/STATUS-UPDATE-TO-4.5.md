## Files Not Updated

The following files do NOT need updates as they contain static story definitions:

- ✅ `docs/sprint-plan.md` - Contains sprint structure (no status tracking)
- ✅ `docs/story-catalog.md` - Contains story catalog (no status tracking)
- ✅ `docs/epics.md` - Contains epic and story definitions (no status tracking)
- ✅ Individual story files in `docs/stories/` - Story specifications

These files are reference documents and don't track current progress.
