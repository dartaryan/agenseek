I'm ready to implement the next story for Agenseek.

**Project Context:**
- Product Brief: docs/brief.md
- Architecture: docs/architecture.md  
- UX Design: docs/ux-design-specification.md
- Stories: docs/stories/
- Sprint Guide: docs/SPRINT-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md
- Story Dependencies: docs/story-dependencies.md

**Instructions:**
1. Check what stories are already complete (look at the codebase/files created)
2. Identify the next story to implement based on sprint order and dependencies
3. Read that story's requirements from docs/stories/
4. Implement the story following architecture patterns
5. Let me know when it's complete

Start with the next unimplemented story.
